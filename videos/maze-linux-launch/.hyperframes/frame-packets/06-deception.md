## Frame 6 — Deception

- scene: A quiet lattice of dark nodes; one node is touched, a cyan alarm ring expands from it and the whole frame pulses once with a cyan bloom; "HONEYPOT TRIGGERED" label, then "Deception Technology"
- voiceover: ""
- on_screen: "Honeypot triggered" → "Deception Technology"
- duration: 2.4s
- poster: 1.5s
- transition_in: cut
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/06-deception.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Negative contrast (the intruder loses)
- beat: alert → power
- asset_candidates:
- blueprint: compose
- focal: (geometry)
- roles: (none — geometry + typography)
- camera: push-in, scale 1.00 → 1.03 over 0.0–2.4s

Compose: no blueprint fits "one node trips the wire".
Scene 1 (0.0–0.4s): a sparse lattice of nine small hint-grey squares (0.6% of frame width) at the sketch's positions, each entering opacity 0→0.6 on an index-derived 0.04s stagger; three hairline connectors between neighbours draw on. `→ waterfall-entry` (opacity form) + `svg-path-draw`
Scene 2 (0.4–1.0s): the CENTRE node flips to cyan and scales 1→1.6; two concentric 1px cyan rings expand from it (scale 0→1 at 22% and 8% of frame width, opacity 1→0 on power3.out, the outer lagging the inner by 0.15s); a radial cyan bloom pulses in behind at 12% and decays to 0 by 1.4s — the film's only bloom. `→ ambient-glow-bloom` (single pass) + `spring-pop-entrance`
Scene 3 (0.7–1.1s): kicker "HONEYPOT TRIGGERED" (label role, cyan) rises at the 74% line.
Scene 4 (1.6–2.0s): the kicker hard-cut swaps to "Deception Technology" set as an h2 line (white, sentence case) — instant state swap, no fade. `→ discrete-text-sequence`
Scene 5 (2.0–2.4s): runs into the blur-crossfade; rings have fully decayed by 1.8s so the seam carries only the lattice + line.

narrativeRole: Fast cut with the video's single loud moment — cyan is spent here as an alarm.
keyMessage: Intruders trip the wire, not you.

# Ambient Glow Bloom

A soft radial glow that **blooms in behind a hero element** (card, logo, metric) and holds, giving it presence. Unlike `press-release-spring`'s click-triggered burst or `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope, this glow is **un-triggered** — it blooms on the hero's settle and stays lit. Two forms: a **hero bloom** that swells behind a settling element then breathes, and a **traveling sweep** that translates a soft highlight across a surface exactly once.

## How It Works

A radial-gradient layer sits **behind** the hero (glow `z-index: 1`, hero `z-index: 2` — a glow in front occludes it), starting at `opacity: 0`. Over the bloom-in window it ramps `opacity: 0 → peak` with a gentle `scale` swell, timed so `BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR` lands on the hero's settle — glow and hero resolve as ONE beat ("powering on"), never glow-then-card. After bloom-in:

1. **Hero bloom** — a **bounded idle breathe** during the hold: a finite `ease: "none"` tween advances a `phase` proxy and `onUpdate` nudges opacity + scale a hair around peak (never a `yoyo` loop). `sin(0) = 0` → the breathe starts exactly at the bloom's resting state.
2. **Traveling sweep** — a narrow highlight band at one edge translates **once** across to the other (`x` off-surface to off-surface), clipped to the surface (`overflow: hidden`). One pass, no return — a repeating sweep reads as a loading shimmer, not a reveal accent (the shimmer-sweep variation below is the sanctioned exception).

Peak opacity stays restrained (**≤ 0.45 hard ceiling**) so the glow gives presence without washing the frame; the glow color is **darker + more saturated** than the element it backs (a same-hue, same-lightness glow disappears into the surface).

## Recipe

  <!-- z-index: 2 -->
</div>
<!-- sweep form: <div class="sweep" id="sweep"> inside the overflow:hidden surface -->
```

```js
// ── Form A: HERO BLOOM ── bloom in soft, landing on the hero's settle.
tl.fromTo(
  "#bloom-glow",
  { opacity: 0, scale: GLOW_START_SCALE },
  { opacity: GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, scale: 1, duration: BLOOM_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  BLOOM_START,
);
// Bounded breathe during the hold — finite phase tween, NOT a yoyo loop.
const glow = document.getElementById("bloom-glow");
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BREATHE_CYCLES,
    duration: BREATHE_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      glow.style.opacity = String(GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY + s * OPACITY_AMP);
      glow.style.transform = `scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR,
);

// ── Form B: TRAVELING SWEEP ── one finite pass, constant glide.
tl.fromTo(
  "#sweep",
  { x: SWEEP_START_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: SWEEP_END_X, opacity: SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);
tl.to("#sweep", { opacity: 0, duration: SWEEP_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.in" }, SWEEP_FADE_START);
```

## Variations

- **Bloom-and-hold** — for scenes <3s or a hero with its own idle, skip the breathe: the single `fromTo` is the whole recipe.
- **Pulse-on-arrival** — bloom slightly PAST peak (`GLOW_OVERSHOOT_OPACITY`, `scale: 1.06`), then a second adjacent tween eases down to a steady hold — one breath punctuating the landing, no ongoing loop.
- **Multi-hero relay** — stagger per-glow `BLOOM_START` by ~0.15–0.3s across a row; shrink `OPACITY_AMP` / `SCALE_AMP` per the `/√N` rule below.
- **Diagonal raked sweep** — angle `{sweepGradient}` (~105°) across a wordmark: the classic one-pass logo sheen. Narrower `SWEEP_WIDTH`, higher `SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY`.

### Shimmer sweep (text-clipped status-phrase working-state)

The sweep re-aimed **inside type**: a soft highlight gradient clipped into a status phrase ("Thinking…", "Analyzing dataset…") via `background-clip: text` travels left→right through the letterforms — the grey-on-grey shimmer that says _still working_. Unlike every other form here it legitimately **repeats while the status is live**: the repetition is diegetic working-state, not idle wobble (same defense as a blinking caret — the motion performs status). Two things keep it honest: it is **bounded** (one finite tween whose pass count is computed from the status window, never `repeat: -1`), and it is **killed at resolve** — the moment the status completes, the shimmer stops dead; a shimmer surviving into the answer beat turns a working indicator into decoration.

```js
// Status shimmer — N passes as ONE bounded tween. Killed at resolve.
const status = document.getElementById("status-phrase");
// CSS on #status-phrase: background: {shimmerGradient}; background-size: 300% 100%;
// -webkit-background-clip: text; background-clip: text; color: transparent;
const shimmer = { p: 0 };
const PASSES = Math.round(STATUS_DUR / PASS_PERIOD); // whole passes, computed up front
tl.to(
  shimmer,
  {
    p: PASSES,
    duration: STATUS_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = shimmer.p % 1; // 0→1 within each pass; percent axis inverted → left→right travel
      status.style.backgroundPosition = `${(1 - t) * 100}% 50%`;
    },
  },
  STATUS_START,
);
tl.set(status, { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" }, STATUS_START + STATUS_DUR); // resolve: dead.
```

Keep it a whisper: `{shimmerGradient}` is the status text's own grey with one slightly-lighter band (highlight stop a step above the base, nothing near white); `background-size` ~300% keeps the band narrow in the glyphs; `PASS_PERIOD` 1.2–1.8s — slower reads as a sheen accent, faster as a spinner. Whole-number `PASSES` lands the band at its start position exactly at the kill frame, so the `tl.set` is visually a no-op. This is the working-state cousin of `gradient-text-sweep`: reach **here** when the sweep _means_ "in progress," **there** when the gradient is the typographic treatment itself.

## Critical Constraints

- **Glow peak opacity ≤ 0.45** — including breathe amplitude; default to the LOW end (0.15–0.30).
- **Glow behind, hero in front**; glow color darker + more saturated than the hero surface.
- **Land glow and hero as one beat** — before or after reads as two separate events.
- **Breathe is bounded, sweep is one pass** — the only sanctioned repetition is the shimmer sweep, bounded and killed at resolve.
- **Concurrent halos compound** — per-glow amps ≤ default `/√N`, stagger breathe periods (2.6s / 2.9s / 3.3s) so they don't pulse in lockstep.
- **Don't combine a `boxShadow` glow on the hero with this halo layer** — they compete and read muddy; the glow lives on the dedicated layer.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

</div>
```

```css

  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,

  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |
